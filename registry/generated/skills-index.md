# Summer skills

> 94 skills, grouped by their primary domain. **Generated** by `npm run generate:registry` from each skill's `resource.yaml`; `--check` fails when this file and the library disagree. Do not edit by hand.

The folder is flat on purpose (`docs/design/DECISIONS.md`, D3): a skill usually belongs to several domains, so categories live in each skill's `facets.domains` and this index is rendered from them. The first domain listed is the primary one. `summer skills list --by-domain` prints the same grouping; `summer skills info <slug>` shows one skill.

Status: **stable** unless marked; *preview* = not yet exercised in-engine by the Summer team; ~~deprecated~~ installs only by name. ★ = installed by `--recommended`.
