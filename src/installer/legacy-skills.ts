/**
 * Skill directory names the 2.8.x package installed into hosts' skill folders
 * (`~/.claude/skills/<name>` and the equivalents). v3 flattened and renamed
 * the library, so a `summer setup --force` on an upgraded machine must remove
 * the entries Summer itself installed that no longer exist — otherwise a
 * retired skill such as `summer-cloud` stays behind and keeps telling agents
 * to call tools that were removed (release review P1-2, 2026-09-11).
 *
 * The list is exactly the SKILL.md basenames shipped in summer-engine@2.8.2.
 * Pruning removes a name ONLY when it is absent from the current registry, so
 * a slug that returns to the library is never touched, and never removes a
 * directory that has no SKILL.md (not a skill Summer wrote).
