/**
 * Consume the engine's generated op registry so this package never sends an
 * `op` the engine has no dispatch branch for.
 *
 * The engine's dispatch ladder is the source of truth; the registry is generated
 * from it (modules/1summer_engine/dev/op_registry/op_registry.json in the engine
 * repo). If this package sends an op the engine lacks, fail here rather than on
 * a user's machine.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. It is exactly how `ScanChanges` (the filesystem rescan
 * the since-removed Summer Cloud pull sent) went unnoticed: not an engine op on ANY
 * build, wrapped in a catch that called itself an old-build compatibility case, so
 * the editor silently kept showing pre-pull bytes.
 *
 * The registry is read from the engine repo's `origin/main` with `git show`,
 * never from the working tree: the sibling checkout may sit on any branch, and
 * a branch with extra ops would make the honesty test below lie. Engine
 * checkout resolution lives in src/test-helpers/engine-main.ts. Absent repo or
 * ref = visible skip, not a pass and not a failure.
