# Changelog

All notable changes to summer-engine will be documented here. Following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.6.6] — 2026-07-04 — "Templates discoverable from MCP"

### Added
- `summer_list_templates` MCP tool: lists all Summer starter templates/example projects (built-ins + the open-source github.com/SummerEngine repos) with the exact `npx -y summer-engine@latest create <slug> <dir>` command per entry. Agents connected only via MCP previously had NO way to discover examples — they hunted the filesystem and gave up. Prefers the gateway listing (`/api/mcp/templates`, server-side curation point) and falls back to the GitHub org listing, then to built-ins with a browse URL.
- Agent playbook startup checklist now points new-game/example requests at `summer_list_templates`.

### Fixed
- Legacy example repos that predate the `template-` prefix (`FPS-template-Summer-Engine`, `Getting-Started-3D-Platformer` — an exact allowlist) are now included in `summer list templates` and the MCP listing; they match by exact slug/repo name only, so short queries like `fps` cannot silently resolve to them.
- MCP failures now preserve nested `failure_reason` details instead of replacing them with a generic `terminalState:"failed"` message. The playbook also documents that `SimulateInput` works over MCP/CLI when sent as a single op against the running game — `failure_reason:"unsupported_transport"` only means it was batched with other ops; the real failure modes are `"not_running"` (game not started) and `"unsupported"` (running game build predates the handler) — and documents the supported `mouse_click` shape.

## [2.6.5] — 2026-07-04 — "Cloud tools don't need the engine"

### Fixed
- Tool descriptions now say explicitly which tools run in Summer's cloud and work WITHOUT the engine open (`summer_generate_*`, `summer_search_assets`, `summer_list_my_assets`, `summer_get_asset`, `summer_get_asset_download_url`, `summer_check_job`) and which need the engine (imports, scene ops). Agents were misreading a missing `npx summer-engine login` as "MCP requires the engine".
- The "Summer Engine is not running" error now tells the agent that cloud tools still work without the engine.

## [2.6.4] — 2026-07-03 — "See-Work + project binding" (unpublished, ships with 2.6.5)

### Added
- MCP session binds to its project; the engine rejects wrong-project writes (`identity_mismatch`) instead of applying them to whatever project is open.
- Structured per-tool-call stderr logging; agent playbook rewritten around the MCP verification ladder; honest game-capture failure states and identity-stamped reads.

## [2.6.3] — 2026-06-30 — "Agent vision"

### Added
- `summer_screenshot` MCP tool: capture the editor viewport or the running game as an image the agent sees directly (`target: "viewport" | "game"`, viewport by default). Lets the agent visually verify scene layout, asset placement, scale, framing, and runtime state — the client reads the actual frame, with no description step in between. Total MCP tool surface is now 52.

### Fixed
- MCP/CLI session now reconnects automatically after a transient engine restart (the engine rotates its api-token and can move its port on relaunch), instead of surfacing as a "disconnected" error.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-06-10 — "Summer Cloud"

### Added
- `summer cloud` command group: `init`, `status`, `push`, `pull`, `restore`, `checkpoints` — content-addressed project sync against Summer Cloud (R2-backed). Code stays in git; big assets sync by hash with three-way merge, conflict sets, and SummerGit checkpoints before any destructive apply.
- Matching MCP tools: `summer_cloud_init`, `summer_cloud_status`, `summer_cloud_push`, `summer_cloud_pull`, `summer_cloud_restore`, `summer_cloud_checkpoints`, `summer_cloud_conflicts`.
- `.summercloudignore` support plus built-in hard excludes (`.env*`, `.summer/local/`, `node_modules/`, OS junk) so secrets and machine-local state never upload.

### Safety
- Pulls stage to a temp dir and verify every blob hash before an atomic rename; mass-delete guardrails, edit-beats-delete conflict rule, and case-only rename handling for macOS/Windows volumes.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-05-27 — "README Polish"

### Changed
- Removed the pseudo-JSON status example from the npm README because npm syntax highlighting made normal setup statuses look like alarming errors.

### Fixed
- MCP generation requests now include client/tool attribution headers and surface provider 422 validation details instead of opaque `[Object]` failures.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-27 — "Project Memory"

Note: `2.1.0` through `2.4.0` were internal package/plugin snapshots in the engine repo. npm `latest` was still `2.3.0` before this release, so `2.5.0` is the public catch-up release for the memory, setup, and MCP reliability work.

### Added
- `summer memory` — read-only CLI view of `.summer` project memory, with `--json`, `show <file>`, and `path` subcommands.
- `projectMemory` in `summer_get_project_context` — lightweight summary of `.summer` canonical files and structured memory for agents.
- `.summer/memory/` convention for locked project facts such as voice IDs, world canon, provider bindings, and cross-session decisions.
- Project-memory checks in `summer status` and `summer doctor`.
- First-class `summer setup github-copilot` and `summer setup vscode-copilot` targets for Copilot CLI and GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
- Copy-paste setup prompt docs: users can paste "Install Summer Engine and let's make a game." into their AI environment instead of starting with npm commands.

### Changed
- `/summer:voice-line` now writes locked cast assignments to `.summer/memory/casting/voices.md`, while still reading legacy `.summer/voice-cast.md`.
- Agent playbook and `using-summer` now require agents to read relevant project memory before creative/audio/dialogue/level/character work.
- CLI and docs now link directly to the public source repo: `https://github.com/SummerEngine/summer-engine-agent`.

### Fixed
- MCP project context now falls back to engine health fields for project path, project name, and current scene.
- Mutating MCP tools now surface failure terminal states and no-results failure envelopes instead of masking them as success.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-09 — "Superpowers"

The plugin rebrand. Summer is now positioned as superpowers for AI game dev — installable in Claude Code, Codex (CLI + App), Cursor, Factory Droid, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Windsurf with one canonical command per harness.

### Added
- **`summer:using-summer`** meta-skill — establishes workflow priority, red-flag list, and skill-invocation discipline. Auto-loads on session start. Modeled on `superpowers:using-superpowers`.
- **`summer:debug`** skill — the missing flagship skill. Disciplined script-errors → console → debugger → hypothesize → propose → fix → verify loop. Honors all 4 cases in `tests/specs/debug.md`.
- **Manifest validator** (`src/lib/plugin-manifests.test.ts`) — vitest test that walks every plugin manifest and verifies each referenced skill resolves to a real `SKILL.md` on disk. Also enforces the "Use when…" auto-trigger pattern in every skill's description.
- **`AGENTS.md`** + **`GEMINI.md`** at repo root — context primer for harnesses that read AGENTS-style files (Codex, Factory) and the Gemini extension.
- **`.opencode/INSTALL.md`** — explicit OpenCode setup guide.
- **`docs/marketplace-repo/`** — drop-in contents for the separate `SummerEngine/summer-marketplace` repo (Claude marketplace listing).
- Multiplayer skills (`host-authoritative-state`, `peer-to-peer-multiplayer`) added to all plugin manifests.

### Changed
- **Brand:** "Summer" replaces "Summer Engine CLI" across all plugin descriptions, READMEs, and orientation banners. The npm package stays `summer-engine` (continuity).
- **README** rewritten in superpowers-homepage style — install matrix per harness, philosophy section, basic workflow walkthrough.
- **MCP_STRATEGY.md** updated: documents the deliberate decision to NOT ship file/git/shell/grep tools (host agents have those natively). The then-current tool surface shipped.
- All 22 user-facing skill descriptions audited and rewritten to lead with "Use when X" for tighter auto-trigger.
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` `longDescription` rewritten — accurate skill count, mentions the host-native tool exclusion.
- `.opencode/plugins/summer.js` orientation banner updated to 22 skills with explicit process / discipline / build priority.

### Fixed
- **Critical:** 4 broken skill paths in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`. Plugin install would silently fail for `gdscript-patterns`, `ui-basics`, `asset-strategy`, and `debug` (the latter didn't exist at all). All paths now resolve.
- 2 missing HAVE-status multiplayer skills now listed in all manifests.
- TypeScript build excludes `*.test.ts` so `npx tsc` produces clean dist without vitest type leakage.

### Notes for plugin install
- After v2, `claude /plugin install summer@summer-marketplace` resolves cleanly. The `SummerEngine/summer-marketplace` repo (one-file marketplace) needs to be created and pushed; contents are in `docs/marketplace-repo/`.
- Existing `1.x` users updating: `npm update -g summer-engine` then `summer setup <agent> --yes` to refresh skill installs.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `summer_input_map_bind` syntax aligned across `fps-controller` SKILL.md and its behavioral test spec.
- `workflow/skill-test` static linter relaxed to allow forward-reference `See also` links to other SKILL.md files (warn instead of fail).

### Added
- `references/summer-folder.md` — canonical `.summer/` folder convention (documents files written by `/summer:brainstorm-game`, `/summer:art-direction`, etc.).
- `CHANGELOG.md` — retroactive v1.0.0 → v1.3.1 history.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- ASCII banner displays on bare `summer` command (`npx summer-engine`).
- ANSI colors throughout: green ✓ for OK, yellow ⚠ for warnings, red ✗ for failures.
- Brand line + colored slash command list in setup output.
- `/debug` workflow skill — triage and fix a bug end-to-end via Summer MCP diagnostics.
- `/play` workflow skill — run the game and report state.
- 7 specialist skills marked `user-invocable: false` (auto-trigger only).

### Fixed
- `summer doctor` defaults to human-readable output instead of JSON.
- Engine path display shortened (`/Applications/Summer.app/Contents/MacOS/Summer` → `/Applications/Summer.app`).
- Home-relative paths now display tildeified.
- MCP server status no longer leaks "stdio" implementation detail (now reads "ready").
- `tools/summer-cli/src/bin/` finally tracked in git (root `.gitignore`'s `[Bb]in/` was silently excluding the npm entrypoint).
- `LICENSE` now bundled in the npm tarball.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- 20-category skill library scaffold with descriptive folder names (`character-controllers`, `gameplay-mechanics`, `scripting-patterns`, etc.).
- `references/` directory with 5 canonical references (godot-version, mcp-tools-reference, collaborative-protocol, template-registry, gd-style).
- `workflow/` directory with 3 meta-skills (skill-test linter, skill-create bootstrap, skill-improve eval harness).
- `tests/specs/` directory with per-skill behavioral test specs (fps-controller as canonical format).
- `catalog.yaml` — 85-skill roadmap with HAVE / NEXT / LATER status.

### Changed
- 7 existing skills migrated into category folders with Anthropic-spec frontmatter (`category`, `template-id`, `allowed-tools`, `paths`).
- CLI `skills install` walks `<skillsDir>/<category>/<name>/` paths.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- `summer setup <agent>` — one-shot MCP config + recommended skills install + doctor.
- `summer doctor` — node, login, engine, local API, MCP boot diagnostics.
- `summer mcp setup <agent>` — idempotent JSON/TOML config writer.
- Multi-agent skills install (codex, claude-code, cursor, windsurf with user/project scopes; Cursor `.mdc` rule generation; Windsurf rule blocks).
- Skill registry (`src/lib/skills-registry.ts`) with category metadata.
- Per-agent docs (OVERVIEW, CLAUDE_CODE, CODEX, CURSOR, SKILLS, TEMPLATES).

### Changed
- `/api/mcp/assets`: removed Pro gate; public/community asset search now free for all signed-in users (deployed on summerengine.com).
- `/api/mcp/log-local-call`: removed visible 100/week quota; auth-gated telemetry only.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- Initial public release on npm.
- MCP server with 36 `summer_*` tools.
- 7 specialist skills (`fps-controller`, `gdscript-patterns`, `scene-composition`, `3d-lighting`, `ui-basics`, `asset-strategy`, `make-game`).
- CLI commands (`install`, `login`, `logout`, `status`, `run`, `open`, `create`, `list`, `skills`, `mcp`).
- MIT license.
